**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I found the topic of Differential Privacy and Synthetic Data Generation most interesting. Learning how methods like DP-SGD and Private Evolution balance privacy guarantees with data utility showed me how privacy preserving techniques can still enable useful machine learning.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For Quarter 2, I’d like to extend our evaluation to tabular and time series data, such as Intel telemetry logs. I would like to compare how well differentially private methods generalize beyond image datasets, testing whether the same privacy utility trade offs hold in non vision settings.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would improve the experimental design by incorporating a broader range of privacy budgets (ε) and adding statistical utility metrics, such as classification accuracy on downstream tasks. This would give a more complete picture of how privacy affects model usefulness.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in using diffusion-based synthetic data models under differential privacy. These approaches could improve generation fidelity while reducing privacy loss, providing more scalable and flexible privacy preserving data pipelines.
